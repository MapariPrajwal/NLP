# NLP Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the NLP Algorithms repository! This repository covers the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms using various Python libraries for language processing.

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence focused on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. NLP algorithms enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way.

## Implementation Explanation

In this repository, we've provided an implementation that demonstrates various pre-processing tasks commonly performed in NLP workflows. Let's break down the implementation:

1. **Loading Text**: The code provides functionality to load text data from different sources such as plain text files (`*.txt`) and websites. PDF and DOCX file formats are not yet supported but can be added with appropriate extraction methods.

2. **Tokenization**: Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual tokens (words, phrases, symbols). The implementation showcases different tokenization strategies including line tokenization, space tokenization, word tokenization, and tweet tokenization.

3. **Stemming**: Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form. The code utilizes the Porter Stemmer algorithm to perform stemming on the word tokens extracted from the corpus.

4. **Unique Words and Type-Token Ratio (TTR)**: The implementation identifies the number of unique words in the corpus and calculates the Type-Token Ratio (TTR), which is a measure of lexical diversity in a text.

5. **Lemmatization**: Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form (lemma). The code employs the WordNet Lemmatizer to lemmatize the word tokens, specifically targeting verbs.

6. **Stop-word Removal**: Stop words are common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that are often filtered out during NLP tasks as they carry little semantic meaning. The implementation removes stop words from the corpus using NLTK's English stop-word corpus.

7. **Spelling Checker**: The implementation also includes a spelling checker using the Minimum Edit Distance algorithm. This algorithm calculates the minimum number of operations (deletion, insertion, substitution) required to transform one word into another. It is used to suggest correct spellings for words based on a predefined lexicon.

## Usage

You can utilize this implementation by integrating it into your NLP projects or experimenting with different text sources and configurations. Feel free to modify and expand upon the provided code to suit your specific requirements.
